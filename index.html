                Hello! I‚Äôm Juliana, a first-generation Bolivian immigrant. I bought my first laptop with my quincea√±era money, and that‚Äôs when my passion for technology was ignited, as I discovered the endless possibilities it offered. I pursued my dream at the <span style="color: #00843d;">University of Notre Dame</span>, earning a degree in Computer Science. During my studies, I took a course in <span style="color: #0000FF;">cybersecurity</span> and absolutely loved it. The complexities of protecting digital information fascinated me, and it‚Äôs a field I‚Äôm passionate about exploring further. Today, I work as a Program Manager, where I combine my technical skills with my passion for problem-solving to drive impactful projects.                
                <br>
                <br>
                Fitness is a huge part of my life; I train daily by lifting weights and am proud to say I‚Äôve lost over 30 pounds through dedication and hard work. It‚Äôs not just about the physical transformation, but also the mental <span style="color: #fb1230;">resilience</span> I‚Äôve gained along the way.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I‚Äôm not working out or managing projects, you‚Äôll often find me immersed in DIY projects. I love making my own food from scratch, including delicious sourdough bread that fills my home with warmth and aroma. <span style="color: #FFA500">Crafting</span> is another passion of mine‚ÄîI've knitted hats and toys, and I even own a sewing machine that I‚Äôve used to create a couple of skirts. There‚Äôs something incredibly satisfying about bringing my creative ideas to life.
                <br>
                <br>
                I‚Äôm excited to share my journey and connect with others who share similar interests. Thank you for visiting my website!

                A friend inspired me to embark on my fitness journey, but initially, I struggled to grasp its importance and only went to the gym when I felt like it. However, after discovering informative YouTube videos, I became genuinely engaged and excited about the process. Now, I eagerly anticipate my workouts each day and love witnessing my strength grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are some key lessons I wish I‚Äôd known before starting my fitness journey:
                <br>
                1. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Consistency is Key</span>: Commitment drives progress.
                <br>
                2. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mind Over Matter</span>: Your body can often do more than you think.
                <br>
                3. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Push to Failure</span>: Challenge yourself for growth.
                <br>
                4. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nutrition Matters</span>: Abs are made in the kitchen.
                <br>
                5. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rest is Crucial</span>: Recovery prevents burnout.
                <br>
                6. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Set Realistic Goals</span>: Achievable milestones keep you motivated.
                <br>
                7. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix It Up</span>: Variety prevents boredom and targets different muscles.
                <br>
                8. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Listen to Your Body</span>: Adjust workouts to avoid injury.
                <br>
                9. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stay Hydrated</span>: Hydration is vital for performance.
                <br>
                10. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Celebrate Progress</span>: Acknowledge even small wins to stay motivated.

                <p style="padding: 0 20px;">Soft, sugar cookies with a thick, creamy frosting on top, often sold in grocery stores. Known for their pillowy texture and colorful icing, they‚Äôre a nostalgic treat for many. However, making them at home offers a much better experience. Not only can you control the sweetness and ingredients, avoiding preservatives, but you can also customize the flavors and decorations to suit any occasion. Freshly baked, homemade Loft House-style cookies have a richer taste, a softer bite, and that warm-from-the-oven quality you just can't get from store-bought versions!</p>

                <p style="padding: 0 20px;">A real treat, even if you live in NYC, where great pizza is everywhere. Sure, New York slices are famous, but making your own pizza at home gives you full control. You can choose your favorite crust style, add as much cheese and toppings as you want, and bake it just the way you like it. Plus, no waiting in line for the "best slice"‚Äîyour homemade version is always hot, fresh, and exactly how you want it.</p>

                <p style="padding: 0 20px;font-weight: bold;">Sourdough Bread</p>
                <p style="padding: 0 20px;">One of those simple pleasures that‚Äôs hard to beat‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also a bit tricky to master. With its crisp, golden crust and chewy, tangy center, the effort pays off in flavor and texture that store-bought bread just can‚Äôt compete with. Though the process requires patience and attention (nurturing the starter, kneading, and perfecting the rise), the result is worth every step. Plus, the smell of fresh sourdough filling your kitchen is unbeatable. It may be a little challenging, but that first warm slice makes it all worthwhile!</p>
